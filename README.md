# TherapyManager
A local therapist in my neighborhood came to me to assist her with managing her clients. As her practice grows larger, she needs a way to add, remove, and visualize her clients on one platform. I built a user-friendly program that can assist her (or anyone) with entering, deleting, and updating clientele information.
